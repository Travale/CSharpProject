Several times while coding you will have to make your code make a decision based off a condition.  In this case we 
will make an if else statment.  A good example of an if statement would be an if else statement based on the heat
of coffee.  If the coffee temperature is higher than the hot limit then we can alert: "The coffee is too hot".
We can the use the else if statement to compare the temperature to the minimum value.  If the value goes below the minimum
we can alert: "The coffee is too cold.  Last we can put a final else statement if the coffee is neither too hot or
cold.  This will activate the string "The coffee is just right".
