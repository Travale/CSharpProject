Coding syntax is the structure of the language.  The dot or "." operator must be known to read and write code just 
as many other operators are needed.  A dot is put between commands and is used execute heirarchy among them.  The dot 
command allows us to seperate and access peices of a combined item in Unity.  Next the semicolon is used to terminate
statements.  It is also important to indent code properly.  Make sure each new curly brace lines up with the code block
it corresponds to.  Last, single line comments can be written after // and multiple line comments can be written with
/* */.  

Scripts are made of one or more classes in Unity.  The declarations you make are hidden.  This means that what you write
in to the script will automatically be in the class.  Choose the type of variable you want then name it.  After this you
can give the variable a default value.  Differently in javascript you type the word var before the variable name.  This is
followed by a colon then the variable type = to a value.  The code "#pragma strict" at the top of the page requires you
to select a type. In C# functions have a parameter list following the name.  The default access modifiers for C# is private while
javascript is public.
