When making multiple decisions in code you can either use an if else statement or a switch statement.  When you want to compare
a single variable to  a series of constants, use a switch.  If you want to make a character answer based on their 
intelligence then use a switch to hold all of the greetings. Store the number of intelligence in a variable.  Create a function
to hold the greetings.  The switch statement starts with the word switch and inside of it is put the word case with the 
number of intelligence next to it followed by a : sign. End a case with the command "break".  At the end of the switch
type the "default" command.  This will run when every other case has failed.
