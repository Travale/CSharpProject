On classes the video explains that variables are boxes holding machines.  The class holds the machines and boxes inside of itself
When you create a fresh C# script the editor will put the word class in the first line after the "using" lines.  The class shares the 
same title of the script it is in.  Classes should be dedicated to one task.  Classes can depend on  a constructor which  is a function that can be used to give
variables to a class. Constructors can be made to set perameters to variables.  The name of the constructor must be the name of the class every time it is used.
Create new instances by calling constructors and give them parameters.

The scope in C# is the place in code that variables can be used in.  Code blocks are usually what defines the scopes reach.  variables given to classes always 
have access modifiers written before them. It is written before a data type.  Values assigned to variables can be overridden in unity's inspector.  Variable's
values in the inspector can again be overriden in a constructor made specific for that purpose.  Private variables are the default modifier for all varaibles.
You can only call the public peices of script that you create. When calling a public variable the code will automatically try to auto complete with all the 
public variables readily available. Test
