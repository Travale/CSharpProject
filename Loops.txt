Loops are tools used to repeat code.  The while loop starts with the word while.  Next to the while the conditional 
is put in parentheses.  If the conditional is true the while loop will keep going.  Do while loops differ as they test
a condition at the end of the body.  A simi colon is put after the conditional in a do while loop.  For loops use
a different syntax than the while loop.  For a for loop the word for is used followed by three different conditionals.
First declare the int then set the int as a conditional then increment or decrement the int.  The for each loop is
good for looping through arrays.  In the conditional the type of variable is typed.
